Welcome to my lecture notes repository on Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML). This site is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for students, professionals, and enthusiasts interested in exploring the vast and exciting fields of DL and ML.

## Who Am I?

My name is Sayan Dasgupta. I am currently working as a Principal Data Scientist, with a robust background in mathematics, classical statistics, and machine learning. As I continue to explore and delve deeper into the field of Deep Learning, I aim to leverage my knowledge and experience to share insights and foster learning within the community.


## Purpose of This Site

This site is a curated collection of lecture notes, resources, and insights gathered from various courses, seminars, and self-study sessions. The primary aim is to provide a structured and easy-to-follow guide for anyone looking to understand and apply concepts in DL and ML. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to deepen your understanding, you'll find valuable information here.


## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- **Lecture Notes**: Detailed notes from various courses and lectures on DL and ML topics, including but not limited to neural networks, deep learning algorithms, supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and more.
- **Animated Graphs**: Visual aids created using Manim to help conceptualize and understand complex topics. These animations bring theoretical concepts to life, making them easier to grasp.
- **Code Examples**: Practical code snippets and examples, primarily using Python, to demonstrate how theoretical concepts are implemented in real-world scenarios.
- **Quarto Projects**: Interactive Quarto projects that you can explore and modify to enhance your learning experience.
- **Additional Resources**: Links to research papers, articles, books, and online courses that I have found particularly useful.

## Why I Created This Site

I believe in the power of shared knowledge and the importance of making education accessible to all. By compiling and organizing my notes and resources, I hope to contribute to the learning community and provide a useful tool for anyone passionate about DL and ML.
